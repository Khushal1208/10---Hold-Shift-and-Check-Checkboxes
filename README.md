🔥 Day 10 of #30Days30Projects – Advanced Checkbox Manager!

Today, I took my Shift-Click Checkbox Selection project to the next level! 🚀

I built a Checkbox Manager where you can:
✔ Select multiple checkboxes with Shift (like Gmail 📩)
➕ Dynamically add checkboxes
❌ Delete checkboxes
✅ Select all checkboxes at once

💡 Key Learnings & Concepts:
🔹 DOM Manipulation – Creating & removing elements dynamically
🔹 Event Handling – Handling click and shiftKey events efficiently
🔹 Efficient UI Interactions – Making user experience smoother

🔍 Real-World Use Cases:
📌 Email selection in Gmail
📌 File selection in Windows/Mac
📌 Bulk actions in web applications

👨‍💻 Code in Action: [Project Link (if available)]

This challenge keeps getting more exciting! Looking forward to Day 11! 🔥
